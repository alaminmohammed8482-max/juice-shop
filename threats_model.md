### Overview

OWASP Juice Shop is a deliberately insecure web application used for learning and testing web security vulnerabilities. The goal of this project is to apply Secure SDLC practices to identify and reduce common security risks. We aim to protect user accounts, payment information, and personal data from threats such as unauthorized access, data theft, and manipulation. The focus is on creating a secure development environment where vulnerabilities are found and fixed early in the software lifecycle.
